This is a slightly redacted letter that I sent to Councilman Bill Green in order
to get access to Legistar's API. It may be adapted for your own project/council.
Green is helpful and a leader in open-government messaging in Philadelphia. It
may be helpful to find a parallel in your own local legislative body.

Note: this was actually printed and delivered, in an envelope and all.

    Councilman Green,

    My name is Mjumbe Poe at the City Council session on April 28, 2011. I
    mentioned that I and a few other developers are working on a project around
    city council data. This project, called Councilmatic, at its core aims to
    provide the public with access to city council information that is relevant
    to them, in a format that is convenient for them. For more information,
    visit the Code for America projects page:
    http://codeforamerica.org/projects/.

    With Councilmatic we want to help council achieve its mandate to make
    legislation, and information surrounding legislation, truly available to the
    public. We are currently on the way to doing this, but our current method
    requires scraping from HTML and PDF files. As you know, all of city
    council's bills, resolutions, and communications, as well as meeting agendas
    and minutes, are published online. However, while this data is provided for
    human readability, it is far from easy to handle by an automated process.
    Web scraping this information is slow, and puts undue strain on both the
    servers where we host the data, as well as on the city council site servers.

    For us to really provide better access to the legislation information, we
    would need better programmatic access to city council data. We have
    mentioned this to the company that provides Philadelphia's legislative data
    management system and they have told us that, as long as we have permission
    from the council, we can be granted API (application programming interface)
    access to their storage. We are, of course, only requesting read access, and
    it is to no information that is not already available in human-readable form
    through the city council site.

    All we would need is a statement explaining that we are allowed to read the
    city council data through available APIs. If you have any questions please
    feel free to contact me at __<email>__ or __<phone>__, or the Councilmatic
    team at councilmatic@googlegroups.com.

    Thank you,



    Mjumbe Poe and the
    Councilmatic team
