It is totally 3:24 AM and I am at SXSW lacking some essential facilities, but I
am going to get this pumped out before the morning.

LegisPy
=======

*LegisPy* is a friendly wrapper around the SOAP API for Granicus' Legistar leegislation management system.

Inspired by the API work of @zachwills, a talented developer, and a friend, as
well as the Ruby-language Granicus API.

*LegisPy* is built on top of the excellent `SUDS <https://fedorahosted.org/suds/>`_ client for SOAP services.

Getting Started
===============

The first thing you need to get started with this API is an API key.  Getting one of those is easy.  Contact `Granicus <http://www.granicus.com/form/Contact.html>`_ and let them know you're interested in working with their data.

After you have an API key, you'll have to get permission to access your city's or county's data.  I think this is because there's no separation between the read and write API (though there should be).  Contact Granicus to get information on how to get access to your city's data.  Tell them I sent you ;-).  And, while you're at it, tell them to separate read and write APIs.
